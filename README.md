# vctr.xyz - Vector Playground

We're live at [vctr.xyz](https://vctr.xyz)!

**vctr.xyz** is a web app for visualizing linear algebra, vector
transformations, etc.  

It uses a dynamic node editing system that enables users to visualize a wide
variety of operations:

ranging from simple...|...to complex

## Contributing

This was my first "substantial" web project, and I'll be honest, some of the code is
pretty gross.  Thus, I welcome any and all PRs as potential learning opportunities!

### Quick start
``` bash
npm install        # setup project
npm run serve      # compiles and hot-reloads for development
npm run build      # compiles and minifies for production
npm run lint       # lints and fixes files
npm run test       # run tests
npm run test:e2e   # run end-to-end tests
npm run test:unit  # run unit tests
```

## Shout-outs

Like any good project, **vctr.xyz** uses a bunch of open-source libraries, but
 some of the most critical are:
 
 - [Rete.js](https://github.com/retejs/rete)
 - [VueGL](https://github.com/vue-gl/vue-gl)
 - [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash)
 - [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)
 
Huge thank you to the maintainers and contributors of the above projects!
