* Operations to support
** Scalars
 - -s?
   - Could just use * -1
 - s + s
 - s - s
 - s * s
 - s / s
 - s ^ s
 - s % s
 - |s|
** Vectors
 - v * s
 - v / s
 - v + v
 - v - v
 - v . v
 - v x v
 - ||v||
 - norm(v) -> v
 - v.proj(v) -> v
 - lerp(v, v, s) -> v
** Matrices
 - m + m
 - m - m
 - m * m
 - inverse(m) -> m
 - determinant(m) -> s
 - eigenvalue(m) -> s
 - eigenvector(m) -> v
 - v * m -> v
 - translate/rotate/scale/skew helpers -> m
   - Should this produce a value, or should it act like an operation?  or both somehow?
   - Maybe inverse these functions too?
 - transpose(m) -> m
** Mux/demux
 - v -> (s, s, s)
 - (s, s, s) -> v
 - m -> (v, v, v, v)
 - (v, v, v, v) -> m
** Trig
 - sin/cos/tan... etc(s) -> s
 - angle_between(v, v) -> s
** Misc
*** Quaternions?
*** Other geometry?
 - Sphere
 - Plane
*** Branching or other control flow?

* 2D mode?
* Misc node editor
 - More operation types
** Undo/redo support
 - [ ] Current history plugin does not give access to undo stack, which prevents
   me from doing a couple things.  Maybe submit a patch to the plugin, or write
   my own, or just try to find some workarounds...
   - [ ] "Collapse" multiple similar actions (node value updates, cascading
     socket type changes + connection changes, etc.)
   - [ ] Save undo/redo state between page loads?
   - [ ] Clear history stack on load to avoid being able to undo loading?
     (breaks saving between page loads if I go that way)
** Camera
 - [ ] Recenter view on page load?
 - [X] Recenter view try to fit all nodes
 - [ ] Right click pan to match viewport?
 - [ ] Left click box select?
 - [X] When adding nodes, add to center of view and only reposition if node too close to center

** Nodes
 - [ ] More render settings
 - [ ] Togglable rendering
 - [ ] Custom node titles
   - [ ] Render node name in viewport?
 - [ ] Random output colors
 - [ ] Custom paste handler
 - [ ] Slightly wider vector input (enough for 3 digits + decimal)
 - [ ] Truncate input display values?
 - [ ] Condense padding a bit more if possible
** Node types
 - [ ] Render scalar values somehow
 - [ ] Render matrices?  grid w/ transform?
*** Matrix support
 - [ ] New matrix icon?
** Plugins
 - [[https://rete.js.org/#/docs/plugins/keyboard][Keyboard plugin]]
   - Delete hotkey
   - Could I modify this to get copy-paste?
 - [[https://rete.js.org/#/docs/plugins/area][Area plugin]]
   - I think this just gives view recentering like I do manually, but it also gives zoom/translate bounds on the canvas
 - [[https://rete.js.org/#/docs/plugins/code][Code plugin]]
   - Generate JS from node editor (can I go the other way too?)
 - [[https://rete.js.org/#/docs/plugins/minimap][Minimap plugin]]
 - [[https://rete.js.org/#/docs/plugins/auto-arrange][Auto-arrange plugin]]
 - [[https://rete.js.org/#/docs/plugins/history][History plugin]]
   - Undo/redo support!
