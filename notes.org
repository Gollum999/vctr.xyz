* To use custom SVG with md-icon:
- All paths must be unioned if there is any overlap, since icon style uses 50% alpha
  - For objects created from lines, must use "Stroke to path" before "Union"
- Remove any extra layers or templates to avoid exporting clutter (even if they would be invisible)
- Fill/stroke should be unset; they are applied with a "style" tag that overrides CSS
- In Inkscape, export as "Optimized SVG" with "Enable viewboxing" checked
- For some reason, need to apply custom style to get the icon centered properly
  - Note that button circle size is 32x32, with a 24x24 icon inscribed
